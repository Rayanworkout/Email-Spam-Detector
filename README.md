# Email Spam Detector

This project is a basic email classifier that uses random forest to classify emails as spam or not ham (legit).
I grabbed 3 datasets from the web and I combined them into one. Unfortunately, my machine is not powerful enough to handle the entire dataset, so I had to reduce the size of the dataset to 5000 emails. The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing.

I also included the model that I trained on the dataset. You can use it to classify emails without having to train the model yourself.
